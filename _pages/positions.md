# Open positions

#### If you want to work with us as a student or postdoc, send an email to the [group member]({% link _pages/members.md %}) that best fits your interests, and attach the following information: a CV, a short cover letter, a transcript of records (for student applicants) or list of publications (for postdoctoral applicants), and the names and email addresses of one or two referees.

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions

We have currently multiple PhD and postdoc positions available, funded by the PEPR EPIQ grant and the ANR grant for junior professor. We seek candidates that are interested in research on quantum information, quantum algorithms and mathematical optimization. Specific topics they can expect to work on are:

*Mathematical optimization in quantum information and computation::*
  - approximation algorithms for quantum ground state problems
  - characterization of quantum communication capacities and quantum error correcting codes
  - characterization of entanglement and nonlocality
  - applications of machine learning to optimization

Contact: [Felix Huber](mailto:felix.huber@labri.fr)

*Quantum algorithms for MCMC and optimization methods:*
  - quantum speedups for algorithmic convex geometry
  - discrete-time quantum walks
  - algorithms and lower bounds in query complexity

Contact: [Yassine Hamoudi](mailto:yassine.hamoudi@labri.fr)

Candidates can have training or experience in at least one of the following areas: quantum information and computation, mathematical programming, algorithmic theory, complexity theory.

PhD positions are granted for 36 months with a net income of about 1700 € (+ optional 150€/month with teaching service).
Postdocs positions are granted for 24 months with a net income ranging between 2100 € and 2500 € depending on the candidate experience.
The positions profit from French social security and employee benefits (health insurance, public transport expenses, paid leave, etc.).
We welcome applicants from all backgrounds, and promote a friendly, safe, and supporting team work environment.

### Applications for Undergraduate / Master students
We can offer internships for undergraduate or master students. Applicants should have a strong mathematical or computer science background and some basic knowledge about quantum information.
