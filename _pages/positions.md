# Open positions

#### If you want to work with us as a student or postdoc, send an email to the [group member]({% link _pages/members.md %}) that best fits your interests, and attach the following information: a CV, a short cover letter, a transcript of records (for student applicants) or list of publications (for postdoctoral applicants), and the names and email addresses of one or two referees.

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions

We have currently multiple PhD and postdoc positions available, funded by the CNRS, the PEPR EPIQ grant and the ANR grant for junior professor. We seek candidates that are interested in research on quantum information, quantum algorithms and mathematical optimization. Specific topics they can expect to work on are:

*Mathematical optimization in quantum information and computation::*
  - approximation algorithms for quantum ground state problems
  - characterization of quantum communication capacities and quantum error correcting codes
  - characterization of entanglement and nonlocality
  - applications of machine learning to optimization

Contact: [Felix Huber](mailto:felix.huber@labri.fr)

*Quantum algorithms for MCMC and optimization methods:*
  - quantum speedups for algorithmic convex geometry
  - discrete-time quantum walks
  - algorithms and lower bounds in query complexity

Contact: [Yassine Hamoudi](mailto:yassine.hamoudi@labri.fr)

Candidates can have training or experience in at least one of the following areas: quantum information and computation, mathematical programming, algorithmic theory, complexity theory.

PhD positions are granted for 36 months with a net income of about 1700 € (+ optional 150€/month with teaching service).
Postdocs positions are granted for 24 months with a net income ranging between 2100 € and 2500 € depending on the candidate experience.
The positions profit from French social security and employee benefits (health insurance, public transport expenses, paid leave, etc.).
We welcome applicants from all backgrounds, and promote a friendly, safe, and supporting team work environment.

The following PhD subjects come with dedicated scholarships:

    Advanced Symmetry Reduction in Quantum Information (with Felix Huber and Adrian Tanasa)
  </summary>
  <blockquote>
  The field of quantum information is awash with difficult large-scale optimization problems. However, the sheer size of the matrices involved makes – for all practical purposes – their numerical solution impossible. Recent years have seen symmetry reduction techniques attacking such problems with some success, compressing large matrices to a collection of smaller ones. Yet progress is hampered by a lack of integration of analytical and numerical methods, and by the presence of obstructions to an optimization formulation. Advanced symmetry reduction in quantum information (ASQI) aims to radically rethink current approaches to hard mathematical optimization in quantum information, by putting an equal focus on suitable problem formulations in combination with the integrated use of state-of-the-art reduction techniques. First, we systematically integrate powerful reduction techniques: analytical symmetry reduction through the underlying algebras, numerical dimension reduction with Jordan algebras, sparse optimization that simplifies matrices with many zeros, semièdefinite programming sketching, and approximation algorithms. The computational boost will allow to attack long-standing open problems numerically, providing efficient entangled approximations to quantum Max Cut and to bound the number of mutually unbiased bases in dimension six. Second, we develop novel formulations of structured problems in terms of mathematical optimization. We focus on two problems: the quantum capacity of quantum graphs and Bell inequality violations in network scenarios. These pose unique obstructions to optimization such as shifted factorizations and nonlinearity in the state. To overcome these, we take advantage of novel optimization frameworks such as equivariant, trace, and state polynomial optimization. ASQI renders several long-standing open quantum information problems amenable to numerical techniques and provides systematic recipes for formulating problems in the optimization framework and their symmetry reduction, delivering impact across fields.

    Quantum graphs (with Adrian Tanasa and Ion Nechita)
  </summary>
  <blockquote>
  The 'Quantum Graphs' project proposes an in-depth exploration of the combinatorial aspects at the heart of quantum information theory, at the interface between combinatorics and theoretical computer science on the one hand, and quantum physics on the other. More specifically, our project aims at several theoretical developments of the notion of quantum graphs, seen as a non-commutative generalization of graphs. This interdisciplinary proposal aims to develop new combinatorial methods for solving fundamental problems in quantum information, while shedding light on the deep relationships between combinatorial structures and quantum properties.
