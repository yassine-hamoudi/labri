State briefly why you are motivated and attach a CV, including information about your grades and/or research experience. It is strongly encouraged to provide the names and email addresses of one or two recommenders that can support your application.

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions

We have currently one PhD and two Postdoc positions funded by the PEPR EPiCQ grant and .... We are particularly looking for candidates that are interested in the following topics:

*Large-scale mathematical optimization for quantum information and computation problems:*

- approximation algorithms for ground state problems
- characterization of quantum communication capacities
and quantum error correcting codes
- quantum correlations such as entanglement and nonlocality
- machine learning for provable results in optimization

Contact: [Felix Huber](mailto:felix.huber@labri.fr)

*Quantum algorithms for MCMC and optimization methods:*
  - discrete-time quantum walks
  - quantum speedups for algorithmic convex geometry
  - algorithms and lower bounds in query complexity

Contact: [Yassine Hamoudi](mailto:yassine.hamoudi@labri.fr)

PhD positions are granted for 36 months with a net income of about 1700 €.
Postdocs positions are granted for 24 months with a net income ranging between 2100 € and 2500 € depending on the candidate experience. It is required to hold a master's degree (resp. PhD) before starting a PhD (resp. Postdoc) position.
The positions include all the social benefits of a usual French contract (health insurance, public transport expenses, paid leave, etc.).

### Applications for Undergraduate / Master students
We can offer internships for undergraduate or master students. Applicants should have a strong mathematical background and some basic knowledge about quantum information.
