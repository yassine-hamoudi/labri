What files to edit for updating the content of the site:
  - New seminars: _data/seminar.yml
  - Text of a page: files in _pages/
  - Description of a member: files in _data/
  - Picture of a member: files in images/people/

Once the files are updated, it suffices to git push and wait 1 min for the site to be automatically updated.
